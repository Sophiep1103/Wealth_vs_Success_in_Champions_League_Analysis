This project investigates the relationship between the financial strength of European football clubs and their success in the UEFA Champions League. By analyzing data from 2009 to 2020, the study tests whether wealthier clubs tend to perform better in the tournament. Key variables examined include team revenue, player salaries, and club value, alongside performance metrics across different stages of the Champions League.

Main Components:

Data Collection: Financial and performance data for each club, including metrics like team revenue, player salary averages, club value, and ranking.
Wealth & Success Metrics: Custom indices to quantify both wealth (through revenue and value) and success (through tournament progression).
Statistical Analysis: Proportion tests and linear regression to evaluate correlations between wealth tiers and Champions League success.
Findings: Significant positive correlation between financial resources and team success, particularly in reaching advanced tournament stages.
This analysis provides insights into how financial power influences competitive outcomes in professional football, with potential implications for club management and league policies.
